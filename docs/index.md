# Scrat Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Scrat.

Scrat is born out of the necessity to easily store the results of expensive funtions.

To familiarize yourself with the library read our [getting started guide](getting_started.md).

For more info about the API visit the [reference](reference/index.md)
